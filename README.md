*MENU*
by Aaron, Eunice, Jay & Jon

Menu is a mobile-first, single-page web app that serves as a digital alternative to paper menus.

Visitors view nearby restaurants and their official menus, filter menu items (by tastes, ingredients, and diets), and favorite items to their profiles straight from their phones.

Business owners are able to fully-control their online menus and their brand.

Figuring out what to eat with up-to-date menus has never been easier!

Built in a week with:
